##Advertising 

The advertising data set can be downloaded using this [link](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv). 

This data set comes from the book, *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*, by Gareth James, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie. 

The advertising data set describes the sales of a particular product in 200 different markets. It also includes the advertising budgets for the product in the markets for three different media: TV, radio, and newspaper. 

The advertising budgets for the different medias are the input variables here, whereas the output variable is sales.
