##eda-script.R 

This file applies a simple linear regression model to TV and Sales variables in Advertising.csv data. It provides 2 tables for regression coefficients and then regression quality indices. Furthermore, it explores the TV and Sales variables, creating histograms for both variables. The script outputs the 2 tables in eda-output.txt and the histograms as PNGs and PDFs.
